# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Solving the OLG model under the PAYG system** and is about how you can use python to analytically solve and present the OLG model under the PAYG system by use of Sympy etc.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
