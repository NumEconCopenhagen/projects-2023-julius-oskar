# OLG Model under PAYG System

This code provides an implementation of the Overlapping Generations (OLG) model under a Pay-as-you-go (PAYG) system. The OLG model is an economic model that captures the interactions between different generations over time, while the PAYG system refers to a system where the younger generation pays for a portion of the consumption of the older generation.

## Model Description

The OLG model considers an economy with a population that grows at a fixed annual rate. The population is divided into two groups: workers and retirees. The economy features identical firms with Cobb-Douglas production functions, where output depends on capital and labor inputs. The wage and interest rates are determined by the marginal product of the respective factors.

Individuals in the economy maximize their intertemporal utility, taking into account their consumption and savings decisions. The utility function is assumed to be logarithmic, and individuals are subject to budget constraints. Under the PAYG system, the young generation contributes a portion of their wage income to support the consumption of the older generation.

## Code Description

The code is structured as a Python class named `OLGModel`, which represents the OLG model. It includes the following functions, methods, and variables:

- `__init__(self)`: The constructor method that initializes the `OLGModel` class and sets up the model's parameters.

- `setup(self)`: A method that defines the general setup of the model by assigning symbols to various parameters used in the model.

- `utility(self)`: A method that defines the utility function of the model, which is a logarithmic function of consumption in different periods.

- `constraints(self)`: A method that defines the constraints of the model, including budget constraints for different periods.

- `euler(self)`: A method that finds the Euler equation of the model, which represents the optimal consumption path.

- `savings(self)`: A method that solves for the optimal savings of individuals based on the constraints and Euler equation.

- `capitalaccum(self)`: A method that defines the capital accumulation equation based on the given parameters.

- `steadystatecap(self)`: A method that defines the steady state equation, which represents the steady-state level of capital.

The code also includes additional functions for graphing and visualization, as well as an interactive plot using `ipywidgets` to explore the model's dynamics by adjusting parameter values.

## Analytical Solution

The code provides an analytical solution to the OLG model under the PAYG system. It derives and displays the utility function, Euler equation, optimal savings equation, capital accumulation equation, and steady state equation.

## Graphical Analysis

The code includes graphical content to visualize the dynamics of the OLG model. It generates plots to illustrate capital accumulation over time and the impact of changing parameters on capital accumulation.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this code offers an implementation of the OLG model under a PAYG system, allowing for the analysis of intertemporal utility maximization, optimal savings, capital accumulation, and the steady state of the model. It provides an analytical solution, graphical visualizations, and an interactive plot to facilitate the understanding of the model's dynamics and the impact of different parameters on key variables.

Note: The code assumes a specific functional form for the utility function and production function. Further extensions and modifications can be made to explore different specifications and scenarios within the OLG framework.
