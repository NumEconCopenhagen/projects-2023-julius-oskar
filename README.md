This repository contains  
1. Inaugural Project: solving the problems given. 
3. Data Project: Implied options volatility 
4. Model Project: Diamond OLG
5. Final Exam: Exam problems given

There exists individual README.md files for each individual project specifying the dependencies if there are any outside the general Anaconda 3 environment. The README.md files also specify complex functions if they e.g. exists in a seperate .py file. The exam project folder does not contain a README.md file since the notebook is self explanatory and we are of course just solving the given problems.
